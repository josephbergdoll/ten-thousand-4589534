It would be nice if the logo was a shop setting, rather than a theme setting.
But for now, it is a theme setting. The shop logo is uploaded on the theme settings page.
Link to the theme settings page of currently published theme will always be:
http://www.shopify.com/admin/themes/current/settings. In the theme's files, in your instructions,
use a relative link: /admin/themes/current/settings.
To add theme settings to a theme, see this: http://wiki.shopify.com/Theme_Settings
Theme settings are added to http://www.shopify.com/admin/themes/current#config/settings.html

A word on drop-down menus: Shopify has no concept of drop-down menus.
Drop-down menus in Shopify themes are a hack that relies on a naming convention.
To create a drop-down menu, the merchant must create a link list that has the same name as the link he wants the drop-down for.
For example, if he wants a drop-down under a 'Shop by brand' link (say, he has such link in his Main Menu), he needs to create
a linklist called 'Shop by brand', and populate it with links. Once he has done that, there'll be a drop-down under 'Shop by brand'.
Shopify has a visual how-to guide here: http://support.shopify.com/customer/portal/articles/262961.
The naming convention hack won't work well if a shop's navigation uses non-English characters. There's a much more verbose coding solution
that can handle non-English characters here: http://wiki.shopify.com/Fix_to_Drop-down_menu_code_to_work_with_non-English_characters.
A word on sub-categories: Shopify manages sub-categories using product tags: http://support.shopify.com/customer/portal/articles/75425.
